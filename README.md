# Heart-Desease-Prediction



# Problem

In a statement,

Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?




# Solution

I used different classifiers to find which one is the best for predicting patients with heart disease.




# Data

This database contains 76 attributes, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. 
In particular, the Cleveland database is the only one that has been used by ML researchers to
this date. The "goal" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued from 0 (no presence) to 4.

# Modeling

I used LogisticRegression, K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and Random Forest 
classification. My aim was, comparing the result of these classification and finding the best classifier.

# Result

The best resuts are for KNN and RandomForest models
